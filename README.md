#PennyPot

####Currently Work in Progress

A small iOS application designed by [Harry Copeman](http://harrycopeman.com/) and developed by [Matt Nydam](http://matthewnydam.com) and [Jack Callister](http://www.jackcallister.com/). Android is being developed by [James Mccan](http://www.jamesmccann.nz/)

Feel free to clone and mess around. You could even help clear some of the outstanding issues :) 


## To install

Make sure you have [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) installed and then run ``pod install`` in the root directory of the project. From then on, open PennyPot.xcworkspace not .xcodeproj
